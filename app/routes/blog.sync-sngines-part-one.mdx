# Sync Engines, Part One

<Callout>
  **{intro}**
</Callout>

After watching videos on Sync Engines I’m super excited to understand the concept of Local-First and Sync Engines, so I’ll be running a few experiments, keeping them simple enough to get a basic grasp on what it takes to build products using these approaches. If you’re interested, here are some of the videos I watched:
- Tuomas Artmans - “[Scaling the Linear Sync Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2m3jaJixU)”
- Stepan Parunashvili - “[Building a Sync Engine in Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FikTQf8qho)”
- Aaron Boodman on Local First Podcast - “[From Google Gears to Replicache & Reflect.net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgTIsTWoNkM)”

Sync Engines aren’t a new concept. According to [Conrad Hofmeyr](https://www.powersync.com/blog/local-first-software-origins-and-evolution):

> The research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) published the original [manifesto essay](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) which coined the term ‘local-first’ in 2019, authored by [Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/), Adam Wiggins, Peter van Hardenberg and Mark McGranaghan.

Thanks to the likes of Figma, Notion and Linear the idea seems to gaining popularity, but this isn’t a post about the origins or future of Local-First so...moving on.

## How are we going to approach the experiment?

After some high-level research, there are a few key areas I wish to focus on:

1. **Syncing**. I’ve done this a few ways in traditional client-server architectures, but what about in Local-First? How are transactions (or mutations) created and managed?
2. **Conflict management**. Although syncing is part of the process, I want to focus on this because it’s a key component.
3. **Data storage**. Another component of many Local-First apps is end-to-end encryption and utilising the client’s computing power. I’ve seen flat / single-table storage solutions in frameworks like [instantdb](https://www.instantdb.com/), but I want to understand more.

This will be a practical series of experiments. I might record my discovery sessions but at the very least I’ll share my findings here.

## Are you going to use Frameworks?

Yes and no.

Discovering how certain frameworks perform and what APIs are available will be insightful. Mostly I’ll write various tests or create small environments to present my research.

## Next step

Our first topic is **Syncing.**

We’ll build an environment that demonstrates the process of syncing data between clients. We’ll see where that takes us and from there, either **Conflict Management** or if we discover a new topic then we may start that 😄

Until next time 👋
